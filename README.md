## Features

- Standard predefined game difficulties
- Three predefined, unusual shapes 
- Possibility to set custom box-shaped game size
- Custom amount of bombs

- Pause option
- The fact it works properly without major errors is a big feature

## Run it

Download and run it as standard Rust project with `Cargo`:

## ~~Not gonna lie, I will probably not add anything more~~ Todo/Nice to have:

- [ ] Fully functional map editor
- [ ] Leaderboard
